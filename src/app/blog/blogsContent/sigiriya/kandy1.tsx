            The fortress was constructed by King Kashyapa I in the 5th century AD as a royal palace and military stronghold. The site includes remarkable features such as the Mirror Wall, which was once so polished it reflected the king himself, and the world-famous frescoes known as the Sigiriya Damsels ‚Äî paintings of graceful women with intricate jewelry and flowing garments.

          <p>
            Sigiriya‚Äôs layout reflects advanced urban planning with symmetrical water gardens, terraced landscapes, and an ingenious hydraulic system. The Lion‚Äôs Gate, flanked by two massive lion paws carved into the rock, leads to a stairway that ascends to the summit. At the top, visitors find the remains of a royal palace complex complete with bathing pools and panoramic views.
